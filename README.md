# how_we_work
We're a research lab in the department of Biology at the University of Washington focused functional ecology, evolution, and biogeography for changing environments.  Our research is described on our [lab website](http://faculty.washington.edu/lbuckley/). TrenchProject.... GitHub organizations


## Lab mission statement
We seek to identify the mechanisms by which organisms interact with their environment that are most important for ecological and evolutionary outcomes. Mechanisms are central to predicting responses to climate change due to non-linearities and thresholds in biological responses, environmental variability, and the emergence of novel environments. We develop mechanistic models linking phenotype to fitness as a function of environmental conditions. We look to natural history collections and field and lab resurveys to test our models. We turn to biologically-informed data science approaches to test generality. We seek a middle ground whereby models capture enough of the biology for accurate prediction but remain tractable. We are increasingly accounting for genomic and physiological mechanisms as we seek to scale across levels of organizations.

## Lab principles
*	Following our curiosity and aiming to produce interesting and meaningful science will be a more effective route to success that aiming to check boxes for hiring, promotion, or recognition.
*	Conducting research requires learning to take initiative and be willing to fail. Identify goals and plan to make steady progress toward them.
*	Recognize a temporal asymptote in the pursuit of perfection and seek high quality answers rather that perfect ones.
*	Open, reproducible, transparent, and collaborative science is more efficient and fun. Share what you’ve learned in the process with others.
*	Be kind and generous. Give credit, take responsibility. Challenging others' ideas is central to science but do so kindly and constructively. 
*	Normalize “I don’t know” and learn from the inevitable mistakes and failures of yourself and your colleagues.
*	Be forthcoming with problems. Take initial steps toward finding a solution and ask for help if needed.
*	Celebrate success and what is working well and provide forthright and constructive criticism where there’s room to improve. Be open to criticism.
*	Try your best, while recognizing your best changes. Balancing science with other interests and avoiding exhaustion will enable your best work.
*	Facilitate a diverse environment and aim to engage with and learn from others perspectives. Be aware of your blindspots and biases.
*	Share your science is a crucial part of doing science. Aim to steadily disseminate your science through publications but also aim to communicate more broadly.
*	When challenges arise, resources are available through [UW wellbeing](https://wellbeing.uw.edu/). Please contact Lauren to report an issue. Communication will be treated as confidential to the extent possible given that faculty are mandatory reporters for some issues. Graduate program manager Krista Clouser is an excellent resource.
