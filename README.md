# how_we_work
## Welcome to the Buckley research group resources
We're a research group based in the [Department of Biology](https://www.biology.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington focused functional ecology, evolution, and biogeography for changing environments.  Our research is described on our [group website](http://faculty.washington.edu/lbuckley/). Our [TrEnCh (Translating Environmental Change) Project](https://www.trenchproject.com/) is a branch of the group focused on building computational and visualization tools to understand how organisms experience climate change. We practice open science, so you can track our progress in our [research group](https://github.com/HuckleyLab) and [TrEnCh Project](https://github.com/trenchproject) GitHub organizations. 

## Lab mission statement
We seek to identify the mechanisms by which organisms interact with their environment that are most important for ecological and evolutionary outcomes. Mechanisms are central to predicting responses to climate change due to non-linearities and thresholds in biological responses, environmental variability, and the emergence of novel environments. We develop mechanistic models linking phenotype to fitness as a function of environmental conditions. We look to natural history collections and field and lab resurveys to test our models. We turn to biologically-informed data science approaches to test generality. We seek a middle ground whereby models capture enough of the biology for accurate prediction but remain tractable. We are increasingly accounting for genomic and physiological mechanisms as we seek to scale across levels of organizations.

## Lab principles
* Following our curiosity and aiming to produce interesting and meaningful science will be a more effective route to success than aiming to check boxes for hiring, promotion, or recognition. Substance is more important than quantity.
* Conducting research requires learning to take initiative and be willing to fail. We recognize that ambitious projects can sometimes lead to spectacular failures! Identify goals and plan to make steady progress toward them.
* Recognize a temporal asymptote in the pursuit of perfection and seek high quality answers rather than perfect ones.
* Open, reproducible, transparent, and collaborative science is more efficient and fun.
* Be kind and generous. Give credit, take responsibility. Challenging others' ideas is central to science but do so kindly and constructively. Also be open to constructive criticism, yourself.
* We are a community working together, helping each other. Share what you’ve learned with newer members of the community. Celebrate your own and each other’s successes!
* Continually revisit group functioning. Evaluate what is working and what isn’t and make improvements.
* Normalize saying “I don’t know” and learn from the inevitable mistakes and failures of yourself and your colleagues. “The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.” ― Albert Einstein
* When you face research challenges, take initial steps toward finding a solution and ask for help when needed.
* Everyone hits rough patches in research. Try your best, while recognizing that ‘your best’ fluctuates. Balancing science with other interests and avoiding exhaustion will enable your best work.
* Facilitate a diverse environment and aim to engage with and learn from others’ perspectives. Be aware of your blindspots and biases.
* Sharing science broadly is a crucial part of doing science. Aim to steadily disseminate our science through publications but also engage in science communication to non-academic audiences. We encourage social media presences, [educational outreach](http://faculty.washington.edu/lbuckley/?page_id=522), and [plain language summaries](https://www.agu.org/Share-and-Advocate/Share/Community/Plain-language-summary).
* When mental health challenges or workplace conflicts arise, resources are available through [UW wellbeing](https://wellbeing.uw.edu/). There are a variety of [UW resources](https://ap.washington.edu/ahr/working/safety-in-the-workplace/) for reporting workplace issues. Lauren is happy to discuss issues and communication will be treated as confidential to the extent possible ([some mandatory reporting applies](https://ap.washington.edu/ahr/working/safety-in-the-workplace/)). Graduate program manager Krista Clouser is an excellent resource.
