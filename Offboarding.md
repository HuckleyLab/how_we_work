##Project documentation
Project components are all hosted in a repository on Github with a thorough README file.

##Data
Data used in support of the project must be:
*Saved in an appropriate, non-proprietary format with accompanying metadata

* In a public archive (e.g., the github repo or another public archive), or, if data is proprietary, a 'snapshot' version of the data used in the project must be saved in a private repository accessible to lab members

*Linked and briefly described in the project README

##Code
Code used or developed in support of the project must be:
*Well commented and complete

*On Github, in the public project repository

*Described in the README- what does each file do, what language was used, etc

##Exit interview
Set up a time to talk with your mentor about:

*What was the best part of your experience?

*What did you learn while you were here?

*Did you get the support you needed, or could we have been better at it?

*What can we improve for mentoring someone in your position in the future?
