# Lab protocols and coding resources

## Protocols and manuals
* Pace weather [data loggers](https://www.pace-sci.com/data-loggers-xr5.htm). [User guides](https://www.pace-sci.com/XR5-SE.pdf).  [Software for windows](https://www.pace-sci.com/LogXR.htm); others available. [Standard Lab Setup](http://faculty.washington.edu/lbuckley/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/PaceDataloggers.pdf).

* Percival incubators: [Intellus controller](https://www.percival-scientific.com/control-systems/intellusultra-c8/) and [Weathereze software](https://www.percival-scientific.com/control-systems/)

* iButton. [Guide to installing software](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/tutorials/4/4373.html).[Guide to using software](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/userguides-and-manuals/3/3358.html).

* [Grasshopper rearing protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HK-DH1V05pp8BNFbDZXMHibWeuy9Cll6yMpndQdOzH4/)

* UW Biology Fed Ex account # for sending insects, etc.: 297951823. Include the budget number that should be charged.  If you ship with dry ice, you should take this [brief safety training](https://www.washington.edu/research/required-training/shipping-dry-ice-with-non-dangerous-goods-or-exempt-patient-specimens/) and use a shipping label.

## Coding resources
### Server access
* [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) is an open source FTP client.

* [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) is an open source SSH client.

### Figure creation
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is an open source vector graphics editor similar to Adobe Illustrator. Useful for assembling graphs produced in R or GIS into panel figures.

### Analysis
* Have an image of a phylogenetic tree and wish you had a date file? Try TreeSnatcher](http://www.cibiv.at/software/treesnatcher/).

* [Data Thief](https://www.datathief.org/) extracts data from published figures and there are other tools.

* [Estimate elevation](https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/elevation) from coordinates.

* Make images of LaTeX equations [here](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php).

* [Use Netcdf files in R](http://www.image.ucar.edu/GSP/Software/Netcdf/)

* Downscale monthly climate data:[climpact](https://github.com/ARCCSS-extremes/climpact2)
