## UW Biology Mentorship Compact Checklist, Revised April 2021

Mentorship compacts are a method to set expectations in mentor-mentee relationships for new lab members, as well as an opportunity to introduce lab-specific dynamics and overall lab functioning. The checklist below is meant as a conversation starter, rather than a contract, for developing a compact upon joining a lab. Suggested topics of discussion are listed below. Each lab group and each mentor dyad (relationship between mentor and mentee) may look different depending on the career status, goals, and overall dynamics. As you discuss the components of the mentorship compact, we suggest you edit and sign the document to summarize your discussion. As new mentees progress in their studies, dyad dynamics may change and this document is flexible in recognition of evolving relationships and projects.

# Discussion items for the general lab group:
* Is there a lab handbook with expectations and logistics?

Lab best practices, expectations, and logistics are compiled in our GitHub how_we_work repository. Students are expected to document and disseminate their workflow and data via folders in the lab Google Drive. Code and ideally data are expected to be tracked via GitHub repositories. Documenting research products (e.g., updating README files in GitHub) is expected before departing the lab.

* What is the goal of the lab research program? What projects are active in the
lab? How are the scientific questions determined?

* What are the expected working hours, working conditions, and schedule? Do
these vary from person to person?

I do not have expectations for the amount of time spent in lab, but I do expect you to spend sufficient time in the lab to interact and to make the commitment of time and effort necessary to make steady progress in your research and to meet milestones. Balancing research with hobbies and other enjoyable activities is central to success in graduate school, so group members are encouraged to bring their whole selves to the research group. I am happy to discuss remote working arrangements with lab members.

* How is lab meeting frequency, format, and agenda determined?

We have weekly group meetings where we present research, discuss papers, and undertake professional development activities. They are often shared with other research groups and we welcome broad participation. We decide on a schedule collaboratively at the start of each quarter and sometimes select a topic for the duration of the quarter.

Lauren aims to take the lab out to lunch approximately monthly and we also get together for occasional happy hours, dinners, or other social events. Events are optional but encouraged. Lab members are welcome to plan lab social events.

* What is the frequency and agenda of individual meetings?

I generally meet with trainees weekly but am happy to interact with students more frequently when beneficial. I understand that productivity is uneven as are the demands of non-research activities, but I expect students to arrive to meet each week with something they have produced (graphs especially welcome) or learned. We’ll review progress on the previous week’s goals and set goals for the next week. I ask students to complete an individual development plan annually that we will go over together. The process includes assessing progress on meeting past goals and timelines and revisiting research and professional goals and milestones. I also appreciate feedback on how I can be a better mentor for each student’s individual needs.

I am happy for trainees to stop by my office for unscheduled meetings. However, I also aim to encourage independence, so I appreciate you making initial attempts to address issues that arise before consulting with me if appropriate. 

* How is lab data stored?
* What are expectations for documenting research activities (i.e. lab notebooks)?
* What are the expectations for time off?
* What is the best way to communicate with me (the PI)?
* What is the lab mentorship statement or philosophy? Does a written document
exist?
* Who are the lab’s current and potential collaborators?
* How are conflicts resolved and what mental health resources are available?

# Discussion items for the mentor-mentee dyad:
## Mentor/Mentee Expectations
* What is it like working with me- (both mentor and mentee) the good and the challenging?
* What do I expect from a mentor? (scientifically, professional development, personal)
* Where do my salary and benefits come from?
* Who is responsible for knowing training deadlines (graduate school related
activities, scholarships, conferences, etc.) ?
* How (and when) can I expect to receive feedback on papers, abstracts, overall
progress?
* Will we discuss an Individual Development Plan (IDP)?
* Will I be expected to mentor other lab members?
* When I leave the lab, will I be allowed to take projects with me?

## Professional Development
* How often will I attend conferences, and where does the funding to do so come from?
* What networking and/or career development opportunities are encouraged – for academia, industry, government?
* Is funding available to cover attendance fees?
* What are the expectations for applying for fellowships or extramural funding?
* How is manuscript authorship determined?
* What is the writing process like? Who writes the paper and makes figures?
